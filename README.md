### Hi there, I'm Jean-SÃ©bastien ðŸ‘‹

I'm a French junior Data enthusiast/IA Developer!

Currently, I'm studying at Simplon Lyon, where I'm diving into Python, SQL, NoSQL, and all things related to AI development and Data.

With the experiences I've gathered and those I'm yet to explore, I'm actively seeking an internship in the Data/IA field, whether as a Data scientist, analyst, or engineer.

Feel free to reach out to me to discuss collaborations, exciting projects, or simply to exchange ideas! ðŸš€
